**jenkinsctl** is a jenkins CLI based on [gojenkins](https://github.com/bndr/gojenkins) library. ðŸš€

:one: Generate a token for the username that will manage the jenkins.

- Log in to Jenkins.
- Click you name (upper-right corner).
- Click Configure (left-side menu).
- Use "Add new Token" button to generate a new one then name it.
- You must copy the token when you generate it as you cannot view the token afterwards.

$ mkdir -p ~/.config/jenkinsctl/

        "JenkinsUser": "jenkins-operator",
        "Token": "1152e8e7a88f6c7ef605844b35t5y6i"
